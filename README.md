# Facade-DesignPattern
Facade Design Pattern Implementation in C#

Façade Design Pattern states that you need to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. The Façade Design Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

In simple words, we can say that the Facade Design Pattern is used to hide the complexities of a system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. The Façade (usually a wrapper) sits on the top of a group of subsystems and allows them to communicate in a unified manner.
